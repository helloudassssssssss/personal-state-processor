Core Components & Implementation Ideas

**üîπ Face Real-Time Analysis (Emotion Detection)**

**Tools & Methods**:
- Use **OpenCV** (for real-time camera processing).
- Use **DeepFace** or **MediaPipe Face Mesh** to analyze facial expressions.
- Store expressions with timestamps to track mood patterns.

**Approach:**
- Start with a basic **Webcam Face Emotion Detector**.
- Save timestamps & detected emotions in a database.

**üîπ Sleep Tracking**

**Options:**
1. **Manual Input** (Easiest) ‚Äì Just input sleep hours each day.
2. **Use an External App** ‚Äì Fitbit, Apple Health, or Google Fit APIs to fetch sleep data.
3. **Build a Sleep App (Advanced)** ‚Äì Use a microphone to detect breathing patterns.

**üîπ Food Tracking**

**Methods:**
- Use **Nutrition API** (e.g., Edamam, USDA API) to fetch nutritional details of meals.
- Manually input food details and let the system fetch calories & nutrients.

**Example:**
1. User enters a meal name (`"Grilled Chicken with Rice"`).
2. API fetches nutritional details.
3. Data is stored in the database.

---

**üîπ Exercise Tracking**

**Approach:**
- Simple manual input (e.g., `"Run 6km at 9m/km"`).
- Store workout types and durations in the database.
- Later: Use **ML to analyze patterns & suggest workouts**.

---

**üîπ Schedule Tracking (Exams, Classes, Work)**
**Approach:**

- Manually input events (date, time, type).
- Allow visualization of daily/weekly schedules.
- Future: Use ML to analyze stress levels based on workload.

**üîπ Predictive & Machine Learning Features**

1. **Personal Humor Prediction** üßë‚Äçüé§
    - Uses **Facial Expressions + Sleep + Exercise + Food Intake**.
    - ML Model: Sentiment Analysis + Regression.
2. **Personal Battery (Energy Level)** üîã
    - Uses **Sleep + Exercise + Food + Schedule Stress**.
    - ML Model: Regression Model predicting energy for the day.
3. **Extra ML Insights**
    - Sleep quality based on personal patterns.
    - Suggested exercise based on past routines.
    - Stress analysis based on **workload vs. sleep vs. emotions**.

---

**4. Visualization & User Interface**
- **Dashboard UI:**
    - Show raw data (e.g., sleep, food, exercise).
    - Show ML predictions (e.g., mood trends, energy levels).
- **Graphing Libraries:**
    - Use **Chart.js**, **D3.js**, or **Recharts** for data visualization.
