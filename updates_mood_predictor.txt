MOOD PREDICTOR
This part of the project excites me the most because I get to experiment with training a machine learning model. For this, I used Scikit-Learn, a specialized library that allows for flexible and efficient algorithm training.

Recently, I became interested in neural networks, and I initially wanted to implement one from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on pre-built libraries. However, I quickly realized that this is a complex task that requires a solid theoretical foundation and prior knowledge. So, I decided to start from the basics with Linear Regression.

In this case, I chose Linear Regression to train my model using various entries from the datasets I had built over the past few days.

Mood Prediction Folder Structure
The mood prediction folder contains three main files:

merged_mood_data.csv: The cleaned and unified dataset used for training the model.
mood_df_prep.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook where I performed data preprocessing, ensuring that redundant or unimportant data was cleaned before feeding it into the model for more accurate learning.
mood_prediction_training.ipynb: The notebook where I trained my own model using Scikit-Learn.
Training Process Overview
Since this is my first time applying these techniques, I am still learning, so errors may be present. The general workflow I followed includes:

Data Cleaning:

Ensuring the dataset is properly structured.
Removing missing or redundant values.
Preparing the dataset to improve model accuracy.
Data Splitting:

It's essential to split the dataset into training data and testing data.
In this case, I used an 80/20 split, where 80% of the data is used to train the model, and 20% is reserved for testing its accuracy.
Training the Model:

I used a pre-built function from Scikit-Learn to train the model using the selected features (sleep hours, stress level, and calories burned).
This step ensures that the model learns from the training data to make predictions.
Model Evaluation:

After training, it’s crucial to assess how well the model performs.
I used three key evaluation metrics:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
MSE (Mean Squared Error)
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
Since these mathematical formulas can be difficult to express here, I will upload a PDF explaining them in detail with examples.


Model Performance Evaluation
After training the Linear Regression model, I evaluated its accuracy using three key metrics: MAE, MSE, and R². Here’s what they mean:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.44
This means that, on average, the model's predictions are 0.44 points away from the actual mood scores.

Lower MAE is better since it indicates smaller prediction errors.
In this case, 0.44 is a low error, meaning the model is making fairly accurate predictions.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.26
MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual mood scores.

Since the errors are squared, larger errors impact the score more.
A lower value like 0.26 suggests that the model rarely makes large mistakes.
However, since the values are squared, MSE is less interpretable than MAE, so we use it mainly for optimization.
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination): 0.75
R² tells us how well the model explains the variance in mood scores.

0.75 means that 75% of the changes in mood can be explained by sleep, stress, and exercise.
The closer R² is to 1.0, the better the model fits the data.
A score of 0.75 is considered good, meaning the model captures most of the patterns in the dataset.
🔹 Summary & Interpretation
The model performs well, with an MAE of 0.44, meaning predictions are quite close to actual values.
MSE of 0.26 confirms that errors are generally small.
R² of 0.75 suggests that the model successfully explains most mood variations, though there is still room for improvement.


Making Predictions:

With the trained model, I can now predict mood levels based on input data.
For example, if I input 6 hours of sleep, stress level 5, and 300 calories burned, the model predicts how stressed I will be in that situation.
Data Relationships and Insights
All datasets (e.g., generated_exercise_log.csv, mood_log.csv) are interconnected. This means that:

If I sleep poorly, I may lack the motivation to exercise.
If I have an exam the next day, my stress levels will increase significantly.
If both situations occur on the same day, my mood score will worsen, indicating higher stress and exhaustion.
I also explored some statistics and visualizations extracted from the model:

Feature Importance Analysis:
I examined which variables influenced mood predictions the most.
Calories burned had little to no impact, while sleep hours and stress levels were the strongest factors.
Correlation Heatmap:
I analyzed the correlation between features, revealing relationships between sleep, stress, exercise, and mood.

Next Steps
The next step is to refine the model by adjusting parameters and testing different approaches to get a better final accuracy:

Since calories burned had minimal impact on mood, it could be removed to simplify the model.
Alternatively, I could introduce new factors that may affect mood, such as daily water intake, social interactions, or diet.
This project is still in progress, and I look forward to further improving the model and exploring new insights from my personal data.
